          "This very light and handy sized umbrella fits in any bag. The umbrella is decorated with a Unikko pattern, it has a manual telescopic arm. Symbolizing creativity and courage, Unikko was born at a time when there were hardly any flowers in Marimekko's pattern world. However, Maija Isola was interested in the floral theme, and she decided to design a whole series of new types of strong floral patterns.",
